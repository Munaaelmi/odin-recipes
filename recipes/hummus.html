    <h3>What is Hummus?</h3>
    <p>
      Hummus is a delicious spread (or dip) made from chickpeas, tahini, lemon,
      and spices. It is a popular dish in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.
      You can find it in most grocery stores, but trust me, you’ll want to skip
      those and make your own. Homemade hummus is just so much better!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chickpeas (or garbanzo beans)</li>
      <li>Tahini</li>
      <li>Lemon juice</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Ground cumin and salt</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Tahini and lemon juice go in first. Then, before you add anything else,
        turn on the food processor and let it run for a minute or two.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a minute of being whirled, whipped, and creamed in the food
        processor, it turns into the paste. It’s lighter in color and much
        thicker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, we can add the remaining hummus ingredients. I like adding the
        chickpeas in two batches, processing the first batch for a minute before
        adding the rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        When it looks close to done, I add a splash of cold water while the
        processor is still running. After a few tablespoons of water, the
        mixture transforms into fluffy, creamy, whipped hummus.
      </li>
    </ol>
