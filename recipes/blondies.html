      <li>100g (3½ oz) white chocolate</li>
      <li>100g (½ cup) caster sugar</li>
      <li>100g (½ cup packed) light soft brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs (plus 1 egg yolk)</li>
      <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
      <li>30g (1½ tbsp) golden syrup</li>
      <li>250g (scant 2 cups) plain flour</li>
      <li>1 heaped tbsp cornflour</li>
      <li>150g (5oz) white chocolate chips</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the topping:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>150g (5oz) strawberry or raspberry jam</li>
      <li>12–15 Mini Jammie Dodgers</li>
      <li>50g (1¾ oz) white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Essential kit</h4>
    <p>
      You will need: a mixer or hand-held electric whisk, a tin 20 x 30cm (8 x
      12inch) and a lined piping bag.
    </p>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan/350°F/Gas 4).</li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter and white chocolate together in the microwave at full
        power or gently on the hob. Stir with a spoon or spatula until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the caster sugar and light soft brown sugar into the bowl of a
        mixer, then pour in the melted butter and chocolate mixture. Mix on a
        medium setting for 1 minute. Alternatively, use a mixing bowl and a
        hand-held electric whisk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the eggs and egg yolk together, then add to the mixture with the
        salt and golden syrup, mixing on a low speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the plain flour and cornflour together into the bowl, before mixing
        by hand or on a low speed. When combined, add 150g (5oz) of the white
        chocolate chips and the vanilla extract, and mix gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the mixture into the lined tin, spreading it evenly right up to the
        edges of the tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the topping, spoon the jam into a piping bag and snip the end off.
        Pipe 6 lines vertically down the rectangular tin, evenly spaced. Use a
        knife or skewer to drag the jam back and forth horizontally, creating a
        feathered pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Distribute the Jammie Dodgers and the remaining white chocolate chips
        evenly across the top of the blondie batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the edges are golden
        brown and the middle still wobbles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to cool completely in the tin. Once cold, chill in the fridge for
        at least 6 hours or overnight before cutting into squares or rectangles.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      Finch Bakery Tip: Do not be put off by the wobble once cooked – the
      blondie will look undercooked until completely set! Allow to cool
      completely, and then put it in the fridge for several hours before
      cutting. We like to leave them overnight to make sure they are fully set.
