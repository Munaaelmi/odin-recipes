    <p>
      This is the best version of this classic guacamole dip. The ingredients
      are kept to a minimum, so it's as fresh-tasting as possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large ripe tomato</li>
      <li>3 avocados, very ripe but not bruised</li>
      <li>juice 1 large lime</li>
      <li>
        handful coriander, leaves and stalks chopped, plus a few leaves, roughly
        chopped, to serve
      </li>
      <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 chilli, red or green, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
      <li>tortilla chips, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use a large knife to pulverise 1 large ripe tomato to a pulp on a board,
        then tip into a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Halve and stone the 3 avocados (saving a stone) and use a spoon to scoop
        out the flesh into the bowl with the tomato.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tip the juice of 1 large lime, a handful of roughly chopped coriander, 1
        finely chopped small red onion and 1 deseeded and finely chopped red or
        green chilli into the bowl, then season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a whisk to roughly mash everything together. If not serving straight
        away, sit a stone in the guacamole (this helps to stop it going brown),
        cover with cling film and chill until needed.
      </li>
    </ol>
